# Wakey Wakey

Race against the clock to wake up from your dream, or should I say, nightmare! 
Wakey Wakey is a 2D puzzle platformer game in which the player is stuck in their dreams and must escape. Will you wake up or dream forever?

Controls:
Use A and D to move left and right. W to jump. Use R to interact with objects.

Bugs:
-If there are multiple enemies in a level, only the one that the player dies to will reset, and the rest will not.
-Occasionally, jumping onto the edge of a platform will reset the playerâ€™s jump, making them jump higher than they should be able to.
